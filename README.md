## Overview

In this lab, you’ll take your first step into building a significantly larger app that truly begins to deserve the category of a **"data dashboard."** Continuing our journey with **Dash** and **dash_bootstrap_components**, we’ll expand on the concepts we've learned so far and start integrating them into a scalable project that can handle real-world data visualization challenges.

You will be using **Chapter 6** of *The Book of Dash (TBoD)* to guide you through this process. This chapter is a critical stepping stone that prepares you to tackle complex dashboards with many interactive components and data visualizations.
